Opt out of seeing personalized ads

It is possible to opt out of interest-based advertising on your Android device.

Open the “Settings” application on your Android device and select the “Google” menu item. Depending on your device, this option 
may not be visible on the main menu but you may use the search function at the top of the Settings menu to find it. From there, 
select the “Ads” sub-item and activate the option “Opt out of Ads Personalisation” to prevent the creation of profiles and the 
display of personalized advertising. You can delete the advertising ID in the same menu at any time (“Reset advertising ID”), 
then a new ID will be created which will not be merged with the previously collected data.

Please note that if you choose to “opt out” it does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising. It just means that 
the advertising you see displayed will not be customized to you and your interests and may be less relevant to you.
